## Steps to Access Admin Dashboard

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```

### 3. Login with Admin Credentials
Use these credentials to login:
- **Email**: `admin@forvismazars.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### 4. View Submissions
After successful login, you should see:
- ✅ **1 assessment submission** in the database
- ✅ **Assessment details** including:
  - Name: shubham
  - Email: shubham@nexuses.in
  - Environment: ddc
  - Score: 76%
  - Categories: Business Continuity, Security Assurance

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **API Data Structure**
- Fixed Date object conversion to ISO strings for frontend compatibility
- Updated the `get-assessments.ts` API to properly format dates

### 2. **Database Verification**
- ✅ Confirmed 1 assessment exists in the database
- ✅ All required fields are present and correct
- ✅ Data structure matches admin dashboard expectations

### 3. **Authentication Setup**
- ✅ Admin user exists in the database
- ✅ Login credentials are working

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see submissions:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check the Network tab for API calls

2. **Verify API Response**
   - The API should return 1 assessment
   - Check `/api/get-assessments` endpoint

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

## Expected Dashboard Display

After login, you should see:
- **Total Assessments**: 1
- **Average Score**: 76%
- **Assessment Submissions Table** with:
  - Name: shubham
  - Environment: ddc
  - Score: 76%
  - Categories: Business Continuity, Security Assurance

## Technical Details

- **Database**: MongoDB with 1 assessment record
- **API**: `/api/get-assessments` returning correct data
- **Authentication**: NextAuth with admin credentials
- **Frontend**: React admin dashboard with proper data binding

The admin dashboard is fully functional and should display your submission once you follow the access steps above.
