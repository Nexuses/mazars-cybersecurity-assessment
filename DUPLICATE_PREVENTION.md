# Duplicate Assessment Prevention

## Issue Resolved

The admin dashboard was showing duplicate submissions because users were able to submit multiple assessments for the same email and environment combination. This has been resolved with the following measures:

## What Was Done

### 1. Cleaned Up Existing Duplicates
- Ran cleanup script to remove 2 duplicate assessments
- Kept the most recent submission for each email + environment combination
- Removed older duplicate entries

### 2. Enhanced Duplicate Prevention
- **API Level**: Modified `store-assessment.ts` to check for existing submissions with the same email and environment
- **Database Level**: Created unique indexes to prevent duplicate entries at the database level
- **UI Level**: Enhanced admin dashboard to better display and handle duplicate information

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Admin dashboard now shows a warning banner when duplicates are detected
- Duplicate entries are highlighted in yellow
- Added refresh button to update the view after cleanup

## Prevention Measures

### Database Indexes
- Unique compound index on `personalInfo.email` + `personalInfo.environmentUniqueName`
- Unique index on `submissionId` (if present)

### API Logic
- Before storing a new assessment, the system checks for existing submissions with the same email and environment
- If a duplicate is found, the API returns the existing assessment ID instead of creating a new one

### User Interface
- Clear visual indicators for duplicate entries
- Warning banner when duplicates are detected
- Easy refresh functionality

## Scripts Available

### `scripts/cleanup-duplicates.js`
- Removes existing duplicate assessments
- Keeps the most recent submission for each email + environment combination

### `scripts/create-unique-index.js`
- Creates database indexes to prevent future duplicates

### `scripts/cleanup-and-prevent-duplicates.js`
- Comprehensive script that both cleans up existing duplicates and sets up prevention measures

## Usage

To run cleanup and prevention in the future:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-and-prevent-duplicates.js
```

## How It Works

1. **Duplicate Detection**: The system groups assessments by email + environment combination
2. **Cleanup**: For each group with multiple entries, keeps the most recent and removes others
3. **Prevention**: Database indexes and API logic prevent new duplicates from being created
4. **Visual Feedback**: Admin dashboard highlights duplicates and provides warnings

## Benefits

- ✅ No more duplicate submissions in admin dashboard
- ✅ Automatic prevention of future duplicates
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for administrators
- ✅ Maintains data integrity
- ✅ Preserves the most recent assessment data

## Maintenance

The system now automatically prevents duplicates, but if you need to run cleanup in the future:

1. Run `node scripts/cleanup-duplicates.js` to remove existing duplicates
2. The prevention measures will continue to work automatically
3. Monitor the admin dashboard for any duplicate warnings

## Technical Details

- **Database Index**: `email_environment_unique` on `personalInfo.email` + `personalInfo.environmentUniqueName`
- **API Check**: Before insertion, queries for existing records with same email + environment
- **UI Enhancement**: Yellow highlighting and warning banners for duplicate detection
