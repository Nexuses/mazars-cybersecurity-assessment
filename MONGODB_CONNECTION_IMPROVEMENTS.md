# MongoDB Connection Improvements

## Problem
The MongoDB connection was experiencing expiration issues after some time, causing API endpoints to fail with connection timeouts.

## Root Causes
1. **Insufficient connection pooling**: The original `maxPoolSize` was set to 10, which was too low for concurrent requests
2. **No connection monitoring**: No visibility into connection state changes
3. **Limited retry logic**: No automatic retry mechanism for failed connections
4. **Short timeouts**: Server selection timeout was only 5 seconds
5. **No connection health checks**: No ping/heartbeat to keep connections alive

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Connection Configuration (`lib/mongodb.ts`)

```typescript
const options = {
  maxPoolSize: 50, // Increased from 10 to handle more concurrent connections
  minPoolSize: 5, // Keep minimum connections alive
  maxIdleTimeMS: 30000, // Close connections after 30 seconds of inactivity
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 10000, // Increased from 5000 to 10000ms
  socketTimeoutMS: 45000, // Keep existing socket timeout
  connectTimeoutMS: 10000, // Add explicit connection timeout
  retryWrites: true,
  retryReads: true, // Add retry for reads
  w: 'majority' as const,
  // Add heartbeat frequency to keep connections alive
  heartbeatFrequencyMS: 10000,
  // Add server monitoring
  serverApi: {
    version: '1' as const,
    strict: true,
    deprecationErrors: true,
  }
};
```

### 2. Connection Monitoring

Added event listeners to monitor connection state:
- `connected`: Logs when client connects
- `disconnected`: Logs when client disconnects  
- `error`: Logs connection errors
- `timeout`: Logs timeout events

### 3. Robust Connection Utility

Created `getMongoClient()` function with:
- **Retry logic**: Up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Connection testing**: Pings the database to verify connection health
- **Timeout handling**: 15-second timeout for connection attempts
- **Error logging**: Detailed error messages for debugging

### 4. Updated API Endpoints

All API endpoints now use the robust `getMongoClient()` function instead of the basic `clientPromise`:

- `pages/api/store-assessment.ts`
- `pages/api/get-assessments.ts`
- `pages/api/delete-assessment.ts`
- `pages/api/admin/signup.ts`
- `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`

## Key Improvements

### Connection Pooling
- **Increased pool size**: From 10 to 50 connections
- **Minimum pool size**: Keeps 5 connections always available
- **Idle timeout**: Closes inactive connections after 30 seconds

### Timeout Management
- **Server selection**: Increased from 5s to 10s
- **Connection timeout**: Added explicit 10s connection timeout
- **Socket timeout**: Maintained at 45s for long operations

### Reliability Features
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retry for failed connections
- **Health checks**: Database ping to verify connection health
- **Exponential backoff**: Smart retry delays (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Connection monitoring**: Real-time connection state logging

### Production vs Development
- **Development**: Uses global connection to avoid multiple connections
- **Production**: Creates new client per request to avoid pooling issues

## Testing

Run the improved connection test:
```bash
node scripts/test-mongodb-connection-improved.js
```

This test verifies:
1. Basic connection establishment
2. Database ping functionality
3. Collection access
4. Connection pool status
5. Connection reuse scenarios

## Monitoring

The connection improvements include comprehensive logging:
- Connection events (connect/disconnect)
- Error conditions with detailed messages
- Retry attempts with timing
- Connection pool status

## Expected Results

After these improvements:
- ✅ Reduced connection timeouts
- ✅ Better handling of concurrent requests
- ✅ Automatic recovery from temporary connection issues
- ✅ Improved visibility into connection health
- ✅ More reliable API endpoint performance

## Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

## Troubleshooting

If connection issues persist:

1. **Check MongoDB Atlas settings**:
   - Ensure IP whitelist includes your deployment IP
   - Verify cluster is not paused
   - Check connection limits

2. **Monitor connection logs**:
   - Look for connection/disconnection events
   - Check for timeout warnings
   - Review error messages

3. **Test connection manually**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-mongodb-connection-improved.js
   ```

4. **Check deployment environment**:
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check for network connectivity issues
   - Review server resource usage
